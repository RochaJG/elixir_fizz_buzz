# ElixirFizzBuzz

> A simple project to prof Elixir concepts.

That application converts every 3 multiple into `fizz` and every 5 multiple into `buzz` by a file provided with a list of numbers. 
Like loading the [numbers.txt](numbers.txt) and returnig that response:

```elixir
{:ok, [1, 2, :fizz, 4, :buzz, :buzz, :fizzbuzz, :buzz]}
```
